Inventory Information
all inventory types = https://github.com/manymade/Skript-2025-Present/blob/main/Inventory/Resources/Inventory%20Types

slot = each square box that a item can go in.
row = 9 slots per row & the row limit in a GUI is 6 (9*6 = 54 slots)
array-based = 
    look up in your browser: what and how does a java array work
    each slot goes to a specific number/index and 
    is zero-based: 
        slot 1 is actually slot 0
        slot 2 is actually slot 1
        and so on...
